 <h1>Diego Quintal's Top 5 Movies</h1>
 <h2>Here is my current list of my Top 5 favourite movies of all time:</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>5. Dune</h3>
 <p>The first time I watched this movie was an experience like no other, I had no clue what was going on. However, I was so intrigued and interested in finding out more about the film's characters, lore etc; that I actually researched everything there is to know about the Dune universe and I immediately fell in love with the fictional world of Dune. This was a feeling no other movie has ever made me feel.</p>
 <br>
 <h3>4. Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse</h3>
 <p>This movie is arguably one of the best animated movies of all time. The animation style was unique and truly paved the way for the animated movie genre. </p>
 <br>
 <h3>3. Call Me By Your Name</h3>
 <p>This movie is one of the if not the most iconic movie in Gay Culture. As a gay dude I truly felt this movie and it will always make me shed a tear.</p>
 <br>
 <h3>2. The Hunger Games</h3>
 <p>The amount of love I have for this dystopian franchise is immeasurable. I love every single one of 'The Hunger Games' movies, but the first movie will always have a special place in my heart.</p>
 <br>
 <h3>1. Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
 <p>Infinity War is, in my opinion, the best superhero team up movie of all time. It is jam-packed with incredible action scenes and emotion.</p>
